# OS-Lab1
Implementation of lab #1, shell lab, which was done using Replit.

To run the file, you can go to [Replit](https://replit.com/) and import this project by selecting the "+" under Create, then selecting "import from GitHub" in the top right and pasting in the link to this project, which is https://github.com/jkolib/OS-Lab1.

Next, select the file replit.txt from the files tab on the left and then copy the contents of this file into the .replit file under the Config files. All that's left to do is hit the green play button at the top of the page and the program should now be running and looking for user input.
